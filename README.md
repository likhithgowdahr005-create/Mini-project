# Hologram View – Camera Based Web Application

## Description
This project demonstrates a **real-time hologram visualization system** using a device camera.
The application mirrors and tiles the live video feed to simulate a **holographic display effect**,
which can be viewed using a hologram pyramid.

This project is developed as a **college mini project** and focuses on real-time visualization
using modern web technologies.
